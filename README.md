# keiba — ecological individuality & competitive context

**研究の中心：競走馬の個体差・環境反応規範・競争相手の構成が、相対的な競走成績をどう変えるか。**

This repository is being developed as a reproducible observational research program at the intersection of **individual ecology, phenotypic plasticity, competitive interactions and equine performance science**. The ecological hypotheses are currently **proposed, not empirically supported**.

## Research questions

1. **Individual reaction norms:** do horses differ in how their performances change with ground condition, after controlling for course, distance, age, class and jockey?
2. **Biotic context:** does a horse's historically measured running-style profile interact with the pre-race composition of opponents?
3. **Specialization** (exploratory): is environmental performance specialization associated with a robustness trade-off, after correcting for selective race entry?

## Current evidence / not yet done

- Present on the separate experimental branch [analysis/kyoto-20261012](https://github.com/zuizui0223/keiba/tree/analysis/kyoto-20261012): a single Kyoto race-day card with descriptive horse histories, source/time-stamped odds snapshots, market-comparison scripts and reproducibility checks.
- **Not yet present on this research branch**: multi-year horse–race panel, official finish-time outcome table, pre-race opponent-behavior history, fitted random-slope models, or out-of-time validation.
- One-day win/place/third summaries cannot establish reaction norms, adaptive specialization, animal personality, natural selection, competition causality, or expected wagering returns.

## Research vs decision support

Ecological outputs will focus on conditional performance curves, horse-level slope variation, opponent-context interactions and uncertainty, with temporal validation and explicit competing explanations.

Historical odds/ticket analysis and betting decision support belong to the [separate Kyoto draft PR](https://github.com/zuizui0223/keiba/pull/1). They will not count as ecological evidence. No bet placing or financial return claims are made here.

Already-published mixed-model and track-condition studies mean this is **not** a novelty claim. The proposed competition × individual-environment interaction and robust longitudinal validation require literature review and independent verification.
